Documentation of PAL implementation (since my original log evidently was deleted in my computer format):

Do not use the Pre-make instructions on the PAL website as they look deprecated and they dont really 
work/the steps are so spaced out they're hard to understand.  

Download PAL using: svn co https://pal.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pal pal

Of course, make sure you have everything required to run the simulation mentioned in the Thunderbots SVN.

I would suggest following Link a) in running PAL with a BULLET library demo.  This outlines the steps on 
implementing PAL.  Note that the compiler fails to move btActionInterface.h when "make install" is run.

Please note that when implementing PAL with cmake it may complain about Iirlicht files.  The Iirlicht 
library is associated with the demos that PAL uses.  You can turn them off with commands mentioned in d).

Also, I ran into errors when using the ccmake GUI.  For some reason my efforts to specify the folder 
(../pal/pal) in the GUI gave an error.  However, using ccmake in the command line it worked.  
(Gave the required options for PAL like PAL_BUILD_NEWTON, PAL_BUILD_HAVOK, PAL_BUILD_2DBOX, Etc.)

Though I was able to get the BULLET demo running I continuously ran into numerous errors getting 
PAL to run ODE with our files.  Some include, CMake binaries not showing up. 
 Cmake options not showing up.  Unfixable compile errors.
