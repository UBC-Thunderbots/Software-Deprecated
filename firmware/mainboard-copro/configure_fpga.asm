	; ==================
	;
	; This file contains the code to run the FPGA configuration sequence and get
	; the FPGA bootstrapped. After the FPGA is bootstrapped, the code jumps to
	; the ADC-and-XBee-monitor routine.

	bsf LAT_PROG_B, PIN_PROG_B

	; While FPGA is configuring, blink LED slowly with 12.5% duty cycle.
	movlw 7
	call led_blink

	; Once the FPGA is finished configuring itself, the DONE pin will go high.
	; Wait until that happens. If the bootload pin is driven high during this
	; time, reset the PIC (also if the emergency erase pin is driven low).

	bra wait_for_done

	; Wait a bit for stabilization.
	call sleep_1ms

	; The FPGA has now configured itself. Run as an ADC from now on.
	goto adc
