	; bootload.asm
	; ============
	;
	; This file contains the code to talk to the XBee when in bootloader mode.
	; This allows the FPGA configuration bitstream to be updated over the radio.
	;
	; The general structure of the communication protocol is as follows:
	;
	; The host sends over the radio a COMMAND. The COMMAND packet has this form:
	;  1 byte command ID
	;  2 bytes page number
	;  n bytes command data
	;
	; The bootloader receives the command, handles it, and optionally sends back
	; a RESPONSE. The RESPONSE packet has this form:
	;  1 byte command ID
	;    This byte has the same value as the corresponding byte in the command
	;    packet.
	;  1 byte command status
	;    This byte contains one of the COMMAND_STATUS_* constants.
	;  n bytes response data (only if status is COMMAND_STATUS_OK)
	;
	; If a command is listed as having a response of "None", the bootloader does
	; not send a response and the host is permitted to send additional commands
	; immediately, with flow control being handled by RTS/CTS and XBee ACKs. If
	; a command is listed as having a response, the host is expected to wait for
	; the response before sending additional commands.
