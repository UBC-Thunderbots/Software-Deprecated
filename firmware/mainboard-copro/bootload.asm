	; bootload.asm
	; ============
	;
	; This file contains the code to talk to the XBee when in bootloader mode.
	; This allows the FPGA configuration bitstream to be updated over the radio.
	;
	; The general structure of the communication protocol is as follows:
	;
	; The host sends over the radio a COMMAND. The COMMAND packet has this form:
	;  1 byte command ID
	;  2 bytes page number
	;  n bytes command data
	;
	; The bootloader receives the command, handles it, and sends back a
	; RESPONSE. The RESPONSE packet has this form:
	;  1 byte command ID
	;    This byte has the same value as the corresponding byte in the command
	;    packet.
	;  1 byte command status
	;    This byte contains one of the COMMAND_STATUS_* constants.
	;  n bytes response data (only if status is COMMAND_STATUS_OK)
	;
	; The host is expected to only send another command after receiving the
	; previous command's response.
