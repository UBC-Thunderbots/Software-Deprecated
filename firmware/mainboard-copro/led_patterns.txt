LED Patterns and their Meanings
===============================

Period:     1048ms
Duty Cycle: 50%
Meaning:    FPGA is configuring. If pattern held for a long period of time, configuration bitstream in Flash may be corrupt.

Period:     N/A
Duty Cycle: 100%
Meaning:    FPGA is running. Microcontroller is acting as analogue-to-digital converter.

Period:     1048ms
Duty Cycle: 12.5%
Meaning:    FPGA is halted. Microcontroller is acting as bootloader.

Period:     262ms
Duty Cycle: 50%
Meaning:    FPGA is halted. Microcontroller is performing emergency erase of Flash.

Period:     1048ms
Duty Cycle: 87.5%
Meaning:    FPGA is halted. Microcontroller has finished emergency erase of Flash.
