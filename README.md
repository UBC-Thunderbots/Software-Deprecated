This is the old version of our software that was used from 2006 - RoboCup 2018. It has since been replaced with [our new Software repository](https://github.com/UBC-Thunderbots/Software) and should not be used. It is intended to be used a a reference only.

### A Brief History
This version of our software has been around since the team was formed in 2006, and has been iterated on and improved up until 2018. RoboCup 2018 in Montreal, Canada was the last time it was used. This codebase served us well for 12 years and even survived a migration from svn to git in 2017.

We ultimately decided that after 12 years it has accumulated too much technical debt and too many hacks to be successfully improved upon further, so have retired this version of the codebase in favour of our redesigned version [here](https://github.com/UBC-Thunderbots/Software), which we re-implemented from scratch.
