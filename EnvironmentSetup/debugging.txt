The software by default builds with compiler flags to enable optimizations.
For debugging, these flags should be altered. To do this, run the following
command at your shell:

export CXXFLAGS="-g -O0 -fno-omit-frame-pointer"

After this, any new compilation will be done with debugging information and
without optimizations. If you want to run the debugger, you'll probably want
to "make clean" before re-making in order to build all code with debugging
information and without optimizations.

The flag will remain set for as long as your shell is running (across multiple
invocations of "make"). If you exit your shell, you will need to re-export the
variable in a new shell.
